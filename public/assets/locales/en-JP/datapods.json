    "westAelio3": "I heard that feeding items to the Regional Mag in Western Aelio makes ARKS stronger. Could it be true?",
    "westAelio4": "Western Aelio has a long coastline running from north to south. It might be better to find high ground to glide to the island.",
    "westAelio5": "You can find plenty of Ore in the rocks, and plenty of Fish and Shellfish along the coast, but you won't have any luck looking for Vegetables out here!",

    "northAelio1": "Scouts have left behind supplies at the mountains in Northern Aelio. If you find Item Containers, help yourself.",

    "northKvaris2": "You can find a ton of Ore at the peak of Mt. Latva. ...But my legs are already about to give out...",

    "westKvaris4": "I spotted a small group of furball-like creatures that I haven't seen anywhere else. Looks like there's more hair on them than anything edible. What a shame...",
    "westKvaris5": "When the hand-like protrusion on a Jungues changes shape, the attacks it can perform also change. Keep your eye on that protrusion.",
    "westKvaris6": "There's a snowy slope west of here. Riding down it on a Floating Board feels incredible!",

    "lostCentral4": "This was once a mountainous area with abundant greenery, but you'd never be able to tell looking at it now. The Kvaris of the past is likely gone for good...",
    "lostCentral5": "I've saved up a lot of supplies for battle against the DOLLS. I don't know if I can win this fight. Please, take whatever you need.",


    "stiaOutskirts1": "The environment totally changed as soon as we crossed the border bridge. This coastline seems to have a lot of Seafood, so we'll work on securing it for now.",
    "stiaOutskirts2": "That four-legged creature that looked like it had volcanic rocks on its back... No. Definitely too tough to eat. Besides, I'm warm enough here already.",
    "stiaOutskirts3": "When Volt Remnus sticks its tail in the ground, look sharp! It's not easy to stop it once it's in a fighting mood!",
    "stiaOutskirts4": "I saw a creature with a long neck and finned limbs. It might still be a juvenile. Maybe I should try to find it again once it's grown up a little.",
    "stiaOutskirts5": "Have you seen a round creature with an armored back? My big brother will eat anything, but I don't think he'll have much luck with that one.",

    "dreisenPlant5": "Don't let Engouku's flailing movements confuse you. If you can stop it from moving, you'll have a clear shot at its back!",
    "dreisenPlant6": "The groups of Gigantix surrounding the Plant are called Recon Gigantix. Don't try and take them on alone.",
    "dreisenPlant7": "Scout Wasps call in reinforcements when they notice you. Try to ambush them with a Dive Attack before that can happen.",

    "mediolaOuterArea1_1": "I think that brings our initial survey of Mediola to an end. Hmm, just what is that structure in the center...?",
    "mediolaOuterArea1_2": "Just what is this place? Hm? I can't see any Recon Gigantix...",

    "mediolaOuterArea2_1": "Nobody else believes me, but I've seen creatures swimming in the lava. They look edible... Probably best not to try, though.",
    "mediolaOuterArea2_2": "Have you seen those weird, long creatures sticking out of the ground? I wonder if the way they're wiggling their heads could be some kind of mating ritual? And more importantly, what do they taste like?",
    "mediolaOuterArea2_3": "Doldoris' greatest weapon is its spiral-shaped head. Maybe you should focus on breaking that part first?",
    "mediolaOuterArea2_4": "I saw a bearded bird-like creature around this area. It looked like it had a lot of edible parts, but all that hair could make it difficult to cook.",
    "mediolaOuterArea2_5": "I saw a four-legged creature with a long tail. The way it stands up on its hind legs sometimes sure is cute. You wouldn't expect to see something like that here...",
    "mediolaOuterArea2_6": "According to our Mags, this place is called Mediola. No matter where we go, Volcanic Bombs keep crashing down around us. There may be no escaping them.",
    "mediolaOuterArea2_7": "Those Lava Pools eventually form into Lava Cores. There's a tremendous amount of energy locked up inside them...",
    "mediolaOuterArea2_8": "Picking up Volcanic Bombs? Who'd have thought we'd find ourselves doing something so crazy? ...But we're ARKS, after all. There's nothing we can't do.",
    "mediolaOuterArea2_9": "What's up with those super-hard Ore Clusters? Our attacks don't even scratch them. If only I had something with more power...",
    "mediolaOuterArea2_10": "Before you can take down the Auto Interceptors known as Sonners, you have to destroy all of their Dazzle Pods. They're formidable enemies to face."
